<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Eli Block, and I'm a web developer living in San Francisco. I studied finance at Arizona State and worked in the auto industry for a year before moving to SF in August 2016. These days I'm taking classes and working on Browzable</p>

<h2>Browzable</h2>
<p>Browzable is new kind of course platform. Instead of buying courses, or paying a subscription, users buy minutes they can spend watching any lesson on the site. Creators then get paid 70% of the minutes spent on their courses.</p>
