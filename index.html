<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Eli, and I'm an aspiring web developer living in San Francisco. I studied finance at Arizona State and worked in the auto industry for a year before moving to SF in August 2016. These days I'm taking classes and working on some projects I'm pretty excited about.</p>

<h2>Projects</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.browzable.com">Browzable</a> was my first app. It's a site for reading and submitting short stories. Key feature is you can quickly bookmark and "hide" writers of stories to take control of your feed.
    </li>
  <li>
    My new project is a site where you can connect private Vimeo videos to be monetized in a new way.
